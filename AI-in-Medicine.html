    <p><strong>Introduction: </strong></p>

    <p>
        The greater attention to detail present in AI systems allow them to detect problems very quickly. 
        In this case we will be focussing on the detection of brain lesions based on MRI data, and you will see that AI 
        facilitates a level of accuracy that competes with the best doctors, while simultaneously being non invasive
    </p>

    <p><strong>DIW: </strong></p>

    <p>
        The crux of this technology is DIW (diffusion weighted imaging) which allows us to analyse
         the way water moves through brain tissues. Magnetic fields excite the water, speeding up how quickly
         it diffuses. We can trakc this motion using MRI technology. Different kinds of water motion indicate 
         different problems, and also indicate different kinds of brain tissue. One can therefore imagine how a 
         machine intelligence could comapre this data to expected values for certian brain areas, 
         and thereby detect irregularities
